  <h1>How CSS Works</h1>
    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>CSS is a language for specifying how a page page is presented.
      <br><br>
      A CSS document is usually a text file consisting of:
      <br>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Attributes that have values that define how something looks, e.g. this font should be blue and size 12
          or this element should be 50% the width of the parent and aligned to the right.</li>
          <li><strong>Selector:</strong> The selection of which elemnts the properties above should be assigned to. e.g. this should apply to 
          all headers, or just certain paragraphs in my document.
       </ul>

    <h2>How does CSS work?</h2>
      <p>When the browser displays a document, it first combines all content from both the HTML and CSS documents into a 
      <i>Document Object Model</i> or 'DOM'. The browser then displays the contents of the DOM. 
      <a href="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11781/rendering.svg">(Visual Example)</a>
      <br>
      <p>A DOM has a tree structure, where each element, attribute and text becomes a 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node/DOM"><i>DOM Node. </i></a>
      DOM Nodes have a parent/child relationship. Some elements are parents of 'child nodes', child nodes can hace 'sibling nodes'.</p>
      <p>As an example: 
      <br>
      <img src="./images/css1.PNG">
      <br>
      ...would be represented as:
      <br>
      <img src="./images/css2.PNG">
      <br>
      ...where the <span class="code">&ltp&gt</span> element is the parent DOM node of the text and 
      <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> elements. The <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> elements are DOM note siblings along with the text, and the 
      <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> elements are also parent DOM nodes
       of other text that are siblings.  
 
    <h2>Applying CSS to HTML</h2>
      <p>An external stylesheet is usually a text file with a .css extension, 
      referenced in a HTML file using the <span class="code">&ltlink&gt</span> element 
      in the HTML header. Usually something like: 
      <span class="code">&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt.</span></p>
      <p>It is also possible for an internal stylesheet within the HTML file. Try to avoid this, but if required the CSS elements and properties 
      would be contained within the &ltstyle&gt element contained within the html header. </p>
      <p>Again, try to avoid, but it is also possible for inline styles that are contained within a "style" attribute within the element. 
      This affects the one element only, and looks like: 
      <span class="code">&lth1 style="color:blue; border:solid black;"&gt.</span></p>
      
  <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
    <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
      <p>CSS consists of two key elements:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Indentifiers which indicate the feature which
          is being styled.</li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> Each propery is given a value which indicates the 
          style of the property.</li>
        </ul> 
        A propery and value combined is called a <i>CSS Declaration</i>, which is 
        contained within <i>CSS Declaration Blocks.</i>
        <br><br>
        A CSS declaration syntax is the propery, followed by a colon, followed by
        the value(s) of that propery, followed by semi-colon. For example:
        <span class="code">background-color:red;</span>.
        <br><br>
        Each CSS declaration is contained within a declaration block. Multiple declarations
        can be contrained within a block. A block is contained within 
        <span class="code">{ }</span>.
        <br><br>
        A CSS block is then assigned to a selector, or group of selectors. A standalone
        selector refers to an element, e.g. <span class="code">p</span> for paragraph. 
        A selector with a fullstop refers to a class, e.g. <span class="code">.code</span>.
        A selector with an octothorpe refers to an ID, e.g. <span class="code">#section5a</span>.
        <br><br>
        A few other CSS statements to be aware of are:
          <ul>
              <li><b>At Rules:</b>Used to convey metadata. For example, 
              <span class="code">@import: 'custom.css'</span>.</li>
              <li><b>Nested Statements:</b>A subset of an at-rule. For example,
              <span class="code">@media (min-width: 800px) { }</span>.</li> In this case, 
              the statement only applies when the nested rule is met.
          </ul>
        </p><p>
          Comments can be added to CSS using <span class="code">/*</span> to start
          and <span class="code">*/</span> to end.
         </p><p>
           Some properties can be shorthand. For example, <span class="code">padding:
             10px 15px 15px 5px</span> is the same as: <br>
             <span class="code">padding-top: 10px</span><br>
             <span class="code">padding-right: 15px</span><br>
             <span class="code">padding-bottom: 15px</span><br>
             <span class="code">padding-left: 5px</span><br>
            ...where the process is top, right, bottom, left. Remember: North, East, 
            South, West.
         </p>
  <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
      <p>There are 6 key types of selector:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple Selectors</li>
        <li>Attribute Selectors</li>
        <li>Pseudo-Classes</li>
        <li>Pseudo-Elements</li>
        <li>Combinators</li>
        <li>Multiple Selectors</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Simple Selectors</h2>
    <p>The simple selectors include:
      <ul><b>Element selector:</b> Applies to an element such as
      <span class="code">p</span> for the paragraph element.</ul>
      <ul><b>Class selector:</b> Applies to all elements where a html 
      <span class="code">class</span> attribute is in use.</ul>
      <ul><b>ID selector:</b> Applies to a single element that has a unique
      <span class="code">ID</span> attribute assigned.</ul>
      <ul><b>Universal selector:</b> Applies to everything. Not used often.</ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Presence and Value Attribute Selectors</h2>
    <p>Attribute selectors match elements based on specific attributes and 
      the attribute values. The selector is housed within square brackets
      <span class="code">[ ]</span>, which contains the attribute name and optional
      condition to match. For example:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="code">[attr]</span> is a selector acting on all elements with
        the <span class="code">attr</span> attribute.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr=val]</span> is a selector acting on all elements with
        the <span class="code">attr</span> attribute where the attribute value is 
        equal to val.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr~=val]</span> is a selector like the one above,
        but acting on one of a space-separated list of words contained in 
        <span class="code">[attr]</span>'s value.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr^=val]</span> is a selector which will select all
        elements with attribute <span class="code">attr</span> that starts with val.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr$=val]</span> is a selector which will select all
         elements with attribute <span class="code">attr</span> that ends with val.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr*=val]</span> is a selector which will select all
        elements with attribute <span class="code">attr</span> that contains 
        substring val.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Pseudo-Classes</h2>
    <p>A pseduo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector. This is to signify
      that the style should only apply to the element when the element is in a certain
      state. For example, only styling an element if mouseovered, or a check box when
      enabled or disabled. The pseudo-class keyword is preceded with a 
      <span class="code">:</span>. There is a set list available online.
    </p><p>
      For example: <span class="code">a:hover</span> selector would apply the style when
      the <span class="code">a</span> link is hovered over. 
    </p>
    <h2>Pseudo-Elements</h2>
    <p>
      Pseudo-elements are like pseudo-classes, but with key differences. They can be 
      added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of the element. They are 
      keywords frocessed with <span class="code">::</span>. For example, you could apply
      the following pseudo-element on the <span class="code">href</span> element to say
      add an arrow after the http: <span class="code">[href^=http]::after { }</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Combinators</h2>
    <p>
      CSS electors can be combined in various ways. 
      <ul>
        <li><b>Selector List:</b> Simply a list of selectors such as 
          <span class="code">A, B</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Descendant Combinator:</b> Two elements are listed, where any situations 
          where the second is a descendent of the first (e.g. child, grandchild etc.) For 
          example: <span class="code">A B</span></li> 
        <li><b>Child Combinator:</b> Like a descendard combinator, but only when the 
          second elemend is a direct child of the first: <span class="code">A &gt B</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Adjacent Sibling Combinator:</b> The next element that is a sibling of another
          element and shares the same parent: <span class="code">A + B</span>.</li>
        <li><b>General Simbling Combinator:</b> Similar to above, but applies not just 
          to the next one: <span class="code">A ~ B</span>.</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
