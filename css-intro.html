  <h1>How CSS Works</h1>
    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>CSS is a language for specifying how a page page is presented.
      </p><p>
      A CSS document is usually a text file consisting of:
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Attributes that have values that define how something looks, e.g. this font should be blue and size 12
          or this element should be 50% the width of the parent and aligned to the right.</li>
          <li><strong>Selector:</strong> The selection of which elemnts the properties above should be assigned to. e.g. this should apply to 
          all headers, or just certain paragraphs in my document.
       </ul>

    <h2>How does CSS work?</h2>
      <p>When the browser displays a document, it first combines all content from both the HTML and CSS documents into a 
      <i>Document Object Model</i> or 'DOM'. The browser then displays the contents of the DOM. 
      <a href="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11781/rendering.svg">(Visual Example)</a>
      <br>
      <p>A DOM has a tree structure, where each element, attribute and text becomes a 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node/DOM"><i>DOM Node. </i></a>
      DOM Nodes have a parent/child relationship. Some elements are parents of 'child nodes', child nodes can hace 'sibling nodes'.</p>
      <p>As an example: 
      <br>
      <img src="./images/css1.PNG">
      <br>
      ...would be represented as:
      <br>
      <img src="./images/css2.PNG">
      <br>
      ...where the <span class="code">&ltp&gt</span> element is the parent DOM node of the text and 
      <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> elements. The <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> elements are DOM note siblings along with the text, and the 
      <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> elements are also parent DOM nodes
       of other text that are siblings.  
 
    <h2>Applying CSS to HTML</h2>
      <p>An external stylesheet is usually a text file with a .css extension, 
      referenced in a HTML file using the <span class="code">&ltlink&gt</span> element 
      in the HTML header. Usually something like: 
      <span class="code">&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt.</span></p>
      <p>It is also possible for an internal stylesheet within the HTML file. Try to avoid this, but if required the CSS elements and properties 
      would be contained within the &ltstyle&gt element contained within the html header. </p>
      <p>Again, try to avoid, but it is also possible for inline styles that are contained within a "style" attribute within the element. 
      This affects the one element only, and looks like: 
      <span class="code">&lth1 style="color:blue; border:solid black;"&gt.</span></p>
      
  <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
    <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
      <p>CSS consists of two key elements:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Indentifiers which indicate the feature which
          is being styled.</li>
          <li><strong>Values:</strong> Each propery is given a value which indicates the 
          style of the property.</li>
        </ul> 
        A propery and value combined is called a <i>CSS Declaration</i>, which is 
        contained within <i>CSS Declaration Blocks.</i>
        <br><br>
        A CSS declaration syntax is the propery, followed by a colon, followed by
        the value(s) of that propery, followed by semi-colon. For example:
        <span class="code">background-color:red;</span>.
        <br><br>
        Each CSS declaration is contained within a declaration block. Multiple declarations
        can be contrained within a block. A block is contained within 
        <span class="code">{ }</span>.
        <br><br>
        A CSS block is then assigned to a selector, or group of selectors. A standalone
        selector refers to an element, e.g. <span class="code">p</span> for paragraph. 
        A selector with a fullstop refers to a class, e.g. <span class="code">.code</span>.
        A selector with an octothorpe refers to an ID, e.g. <span class="code">#section5a</span>.
        <br><br>
        A few other CSS statements to be aware of are:
          <ul>
              <li><b>At Rules:</b>Used to convey metadata. For example, 
              <span class="code">@import: 'custom.css'</span>.</li>
              <li><b>Nested Statements:</b>A subset of an at-rule. For example,
              <span class="code">@media (min-width: 800px) { }</span>.</li> In this case, 
              the statement only applies when the nested rule is met.
          </ul>
        </p><p>
          Comments can be added to CSS using <span class="code">/*</span> to start
          and <span class="code">*/</span> to end.
         </p><p>
           Some properties can be shorthand. For example, <span class="code">padding:
             10px 15px 15px 5px</span> is the same as: <br>
             <span class="code">padding-top: 10px</span><br>
             <span class="code">padding-right: 15px</span><br>
             <span class="code">padding-bottom: 15px</span><br>
             <span class="code">padding-left: 5px</span><br>
            ...where the process is top, right, bottom, left. Remember: North, East, 
            South, West.
         </p>
  <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
      <p>There are 6 key types of selector:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple Selectors</li>
        <li>Attribute Selectors</li>
        <li>Pseudo-Classes</li>
        <li>Pseudo-Elements</li>
        <li>Combinators</li>
        <li>Multiple Selectors</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Simple Selectors</h2>
    <p>The simple selectors include:
      <ul><b>Element selector:</b> Applies to an element such as
      <span class="code">p</span> for the paragraph element.</ul>
      <ul><b>Class selector:</b> Applies to all elements where a html 
      <span class="code">class</span> attribute is in use.</ul>
      <ul><b>ID selector:</b> Applies to a single element that has a unique
      <span class="code">ID</span> attribute assigned.</ul>
      <ul><b>Universal selector:</b> Applies to everything. Not used often.</ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Presence and Value Attribute Selectors</h2>
    <p>Attribute selectors match elements based on specific attributes and 
      the attribute values. The selector is housed within square brackets
      <span class="code">[ ]</span>, which contains the attribute name and optional
      condition to match. For example:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="code">[attr]</span> is a selector acting on all elements with
        the <span class="code">attr</span> attribute.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr=val]</span> is a selector acting on all elements with
        the <span class="code">attr</span> attribute where the attribute value is 
        equal to val.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr~=val]</span> is a selector like the one above,
        but acting on one of a space-separated list of words contained in 
        <span class="code">[attr]</span>'s value.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr^=val]</span> is a selector which will select all
        elements with attribute <span class="code">attr</span> that starts with val.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr$=val]</span> is a selector which will select all
         elements with attribute <span class="code">attr</span> that ends with val.</li>
        <li><span class="code">[attr*=val]</span> is a selector which will select all
        elements with attribute <span class="code">attr</span> that contains 
        substring val.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Pseudo-Classes</h2>
    <p>A pseduo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector. This is to signify
      that the style should only apply to the element when the element is in a certain
      state. For example, only styling an element if mouseovered, or a check box when
      enabled or disabled. The pseudo-class keyword is preceded with a 
      <span class="code">:</span>. There is a set list available online.
    </p><p>
      For example: <span class="code">a:hover</span> selector would apply the style when
      the <span class="code">a</span> link is hovered over. 
    </p>
    <h2>Pseudo-Elements</h2>
    <p>
      Pseudo-elements are like pseudo-classes, but with key differences. They can be 
      added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of the element. They are 
      keywords frocessed with <span class="code">::</span>. For example, you could apply
      the following pseudo-element on the <span class="code">href</span> element to say
      add an arrow after the http: <span class="code">[href^=http]::after { }</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Combinators</h2>
    <p>
      CSS electors can be combined in various ways. 
      <ul>
        <li><b>Selector List:</b> Simply a list of selectors such as 
          <span class="code">A, B</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Descendant Combinator:</b> Two elements are listed, where any situations 
          where the second is a descendent of the first (e.g. child, grandchild etc.) For 
          example: <span class="code">A B</span></li> 
        <li><b>Child Combinator:</b> Like a descendard combinator, but only when the 
          second elemend is a direct child of the first: <span class="code">A &gt B</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Adjacent Sibling Combinator:</b> The next element that is a sibling of another
          element and shares the same parent: <span class="code">A + B</span>.</li>
        <li><b>General Simbling Combinator:</b> Similar to above, but applies not just 
          to the next one: <span class="code">A ~ B</span>.</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>CSS Values and Units</h1>
    <h2>Numeric Values</h2>
    <p>In most cases, sizes for things such as <span class="code">border</span> and 
      <span class="code">margin</span> are done in pixels or <span class="code">px</span>. 
      It's also possible to put sizes as quarter mm, mm, cm or inches (<span class="code">q</span>,
      <span class="code">mm</span>, <span class="code">cm</span>,
      <span class="code">in</span>) but these are rarely used.      
    </p>
    <p>Pixels are <i>absolute</i> units as they'll always be the same. There are also 
      <i>relevate</i> units available to use, which are reletive to the current elements
      <span class="code">font-size</span> or 'viewport' size. Including:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="code">em:1em</span> is the same as the font size of the current
        element. The default font size given to web pages before CSS styling kicks in
        is 16 pixes, so 1<span class="code">em</span> is 16 pixels.</li>
        <li><span class="code">ex</span>, <span class="code">ch</span>. Not used 
        often. Respectively, these are the height of a lower case 'x' and the width of
        the number 0.</li>
        <li><span class="code">rem</span> is the 'root <span class="code">em</span>'
        and works in the same way as <span class="code">em</span> except it will always
        equal the default base font size instead of inherited font sizes.</li>
        <li><span class="code">vw</span>, <span class="code">vh</span>. Respectively these
        are 1/100th of the viewport width and 1/100th of the viewport hight. Not as widely
        used as <span class="code">em</span>.</li>
      </ul>
    ...so <span class="code">px</span> and <span class="code">em</span> is the way 
    forward, but it's recommended that <span class="code">em</span> is good to use as 
    its relative to the font size.
    </p>
    <p>Some values are unitless. For example, using just <span class="code">0</span>
    can be used instead of <span class="code">0em</span>, or for something like 
    <span class="code">line-height</span> the value can be just 1.5 without a unit
    to specify a 1.5 line height based on the default font size.
    </p>

    <h2>Percentages</h2>
    <p>Percentages can also be used to represent numeric values. This allows boxes to
      always resize by a certain percentage of their parent containers width. Typically,
      compared to the parents <span class="code">px</span> or <span class="code">em</span> 
      sizewhich says the same. 
    </p>
    <p>As an example of parent-child relationships, and percentages:</p>
    <img src="./images/css3.PNG" ID="css3">
    <p>...results in the following:</p>
    <img src="./images/css4.PNG" ID="css4">

    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <p>CSS has the standard color range available of about 16.7m colors, all a combination of different 
      red, green and blue options with 256 per option. There are a variety of ways to assign a color in 
      CSS. 
    </p>

    <h3>keywords</h3>
    <p>The simplest option is to use color keywords which are simply specific strings. There are 165
      keywords available, and all are available to view 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#Color_keywords">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Hexadecimal Values</h3>
    <p>Hex codes consist of a octothorpe followed by 6 hexadecimal numbers. A hexadecimal number takes 
      a value of 0 to f, so 0123456789abcdef, where a to f represent numbers 10 to 15. Each pair or the 
      6 numbers represends one of the 3 RGB options from 0 to 256, of 00 to ff. For example, 
      <span class="code">#ff0000</span> is equivelent to 256, 0, 0, or solid red, where 256 comes from 
      f x f, or 16 x 16. Or <span class="code">#0000ff</span> is equivelent to 0, 0, 256, or solid blue, 
      and so on. 
    </p><p>
      Any color can be represented using hex codes, although it's not too clear to understand easily.
    </p>

    <h3>RGB</h3>
    <p>RGB works very much the same as hex codes, but is represented differently using 
      <span class="code">rgb(,,)</span>. For example, <span class="code">rgb(255,0,0)</span> would 
      be red, or <span class="code">rgb(0,0,255)</span> would be blue.
    </p><p>RGB is generally just as well supported as hexadecimals, and is easier to view.</p>


    <h3>HSL</h3>
    <p>HSL, or Hue, Saturation and Lightness, is a diffent way of distibushing between the 16.7m 
    colours. The syntax is <span class="code">hsl(,,)</span>, where instead of up to 255 for the numbers
    after for red, blue and green, you enter:
    <ul>
      <li><b>hue:</b> is the base shade of colour,  with a value between 0 and 360 taken from a color wheel.</li>
      <li><b>saturation:</b> is how saturated is the color, from 0% for no saturation (appears as a shade of
      grey) to 100% for full saturation.</li>
      <li><b>lightness:</b> is how bright is the color, with a value between 0% for no light (appears as 
      black) to 100% for full light (appears as white).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>RGBA and HSLA</h3>
    <p>RGB and HSL have corresponding modes, RGBA and HSLA, where A represents the transparancy of the 
      colour. The transaparancy, or 'alpha value', is a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1 where 0 is 
      completely transparant and 1 is completely opaque. Note that this only sets the color as transparant;
      to make a full selector transparant, use the opacity property.
    </p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>A function is a reusable section of code. Functions in CSS are property values that are followed
      by parenthesis, such as <span class="code">rgb()</span> or <span class="code">hsl()</span>.
      Other functions include things like <span class="code">rotate()</span>, <span class="code">translate()</span>,
      <span class="code">calc()</span> and <span class="code">url()</span>.
    </p>

    <h1>Cascade and Inheritance</h1>
    <p>Previously selectors have been covered. Sometimes there may be a situation where more than one CSS
      rule applies to an element, so which CSS rule wins? This is controled by a mechanism called 
      <b>cascade</b> and is related to inhertance from parents too. 
      </p>

    <h2>The Cascade</h2>
    <p> CSS stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>, so the cascade is important. There are three factors
      which determine the CSS rule that applies to an element and which get overwritten:
      <ul>
        <li>Importance</li>
        <li>Specificity</li>
        <li>Source Order</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Importance</h3>
    <p>Importance froms from a special syntax command <span class="code">!important</span> which <i>always</i>
    wins and overrides other rules. For exmaple, <span class="code">background-color: red !important</span> would
    override any other background-color rule.
    </p><p>
    The <span class="code">!important</span> rule can only be overwritten by either another 
    <span class="code">!important</span> declaration of the same specificity but later on in the source
    order, or by an <span class="code">!important</span> declaration with a higher specificity.
    </p>

    <h3>Specificity</h3>
    <p>This is essentially a measure of how specific the selector is. Element selectors have low specificity
      as it could apply many times. Class selectors have a higher specificity as classes are more specific
      than general element selectors. ID selectors have even higher specificity as IDs are even more specific
      than class selectors. 
    </p><p>
      Specificity is measurable using 4 digits:
      <ul>
        <li>Thousands: Score on in this column if the declaration is inside a <span class="code">style</span>
        attribute, i.e. a direct inline style in the html code.</li>
        <li>Hundreds: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained in the ovrall selector.</li>
        <li>Tens:Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute seletor or pseduo-class 
          contained within the overall selector.</li>
        <li>Ones: Score one in this column for each element selector or pseudo-element contained within 
          the overall selector.</li>
      </ul>
      The greatest total specificity value would 'win'. As an example:
      <img src="./images/css5.PNG" ID="css5">
    </p>

    <h3>Source Order</h3>
    <p>After importance and specificify, the next factor that kicks in for competing selectors of the 
      same importance and specificify is source order. Later rules always override earlier rules.
    </p>

  <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>In CSS, some propery values applied to an element get inherited by the elements children, 
      and others won't. For exaple, properties such as <span class="code">font-family</span> and 
      <span class="code">color</span> properties are good to be inherited, as they can be set against
      the <span class="code">&lthtml&gt</span> element and then apply to everything withing, unless 
      overwritten by individual rules. Properties such as <span class="code">margin</span>, 
      <span class="code">padding</span> and <span class="code">border</span> should not be inherited, 
      as those are set at container element level and child elements are typically different. 
    </p><p>
      Generally, its common sense as to whether inhertance applies, but for each property type see more
      details <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">here</a>.
    </p><p>
      Inheritance can also be specified using the following four universal propery families:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="code">inherit</span>: Sets the property value to an element to be the same
        as its parent element.</li>
        <li><span class="code">initial</span>: Sets the property valur to be the same as the browsers default
        style sheet. If no default applies, <span class="code">inherit</span> kicks in.</li>
        <li><span class="code">unset</span>: Resets the proporty to its natural value.</li>
        <li><span class="code">revert</span>: Reverts the property to that it would have been if no styles
        had been applied to it.</li>
        </ul>
      For example, <span class="code">color: green</span> set at parent level, could be picked up at child
      element level using <span class="code">color: inherit</span>.
    </p>

    <h1>The Box Model</h1>
    <p>The CSS box model is the foundation of web page layout. Each element is represent as a rectangular box,
      where the box needs specific properies defining.
    </p>
