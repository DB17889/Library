            <h1>Introduction to Objects</h1>
        </div>
        <p>As covered previously, JavaScript has 7 different data types. Whilst the other 6 are 'primitive', as they only hold one value,
            objects are more complex as they store collections of various elements. 
        </p>
        <p>An object is created with curly brackets: {}</p>
        <p>These brackets contain an option list of <i>properties</i>. Each property has a "Key: Value" relationship, where the key is a string
            which names the propery, and the value is any value.</p>
        <p>There are two syntaxes to use when creating an object; the second is more practical, and is refered to a <i>object literal</i>:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = new Object(); // Syntax is <i>Object Constructor</i><br>
            let user = {}; // Syntax is <i>Object Literal</i>
        </p>
        <p>Using "Key: Value" paired components, properties can be added straight into the object literal like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan",<br>
                age: 30,<br>
                isAdmin: true<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>...where the Key is followed by a colon (:) and the Value is followed by a comma (,) if another property is to be added.</p>
        <p>Propery values can be called on using the dot notation, like so:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            alert(user.name); // returns string: Dan<br>
            alert(user.age); // returns number: 30<br>
            alert(user.isAdmin); // returns boolean: true
        </p>
        <p>And the property values are set in the same way: </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            set user.name = "Dan";
        </p>
        <p>Removing a property from an object also uses dot notation, and is done so like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            delete user.name; // removes name property
        </p>
        <p>Typically, property names are camelCase, but they can be separate words. Just use quotation, like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan",<br>
                age: 30,<br>
                "Admin User": true<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>...but bear in mind, using multiword property Keys requires square brakets [] to be used when calling on that propery, 
            remembering the quotes still, like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            alert(user.["Admin User"]); // returns boolean: true
        </p>

        <h2>Computed Properties</h2>,
        <p>Computed properties are those which are defined within square brackets like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let fruit = prompt("Which fruit do you want?" "apple");<br>
            <br>
            let bag = {<br>
                [fruit]: 5<br>
            };<br>
            <br>
            alert(bag.apple); // returns 5 if fruit="Apple"
        </p>
        <p>So what is happening here:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We have variable `fruit` which is assigned whatever value the user inputs when prompted. In this case, the user 
                is prompted to enter apple, so just needs to confirm when prompted. 
            </li>
            <li>Then we have object bag which has a computed property `[fruit]`. As the property name is in square brackets, and does NOT contain
                quotations (like a multiword propery name covered previously would), the propery name simply inherits whatever value is assigned
                to the `fruit` variation. So in this case, the propery name is 'apple'.
            </li>
            <li>Therefore, the alert object.property, in this case bag.apple (where apple is inherited from `[fruit]`) returns 5.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Be aware, this does the same, but the first method is better as it is 'cleaner' to view:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let fruit = prompt("Which fruit do you want?" "apple");<br>
            let bag = {};<br>
            <br>
            bag[fruit] = 5;
        </p>
        <p>Typically, dot notication is easier to code. But bear in mind that square brackets are more powerful as they allow any propery names
            and variables.
        </p>

        <h2>Property Value Shorthand</h2>
        <p>In real code, we often use existing variables as values for property names. For example:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            function makeUser(name, age){<br>
                return {<br>
                    name: name,<br>
                    age: age, <br>
                    //etc...<br>
                };<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            let user = makeUser("Dan", 30);<br>
            alert(user.name); //returns Dan
        </p>
        <p>Above the property name and value name are the same, and this is very common with object properties, so shorthand is available
            meaning that just 'name' can be used instead of 'name: name' like this:
        </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            function makeUser(name, age){<br>
                return {<br>
                    name,<br>
                    age, <br>
                    //etc...<br>
                };<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Existance Check</h2>
        <p>When accessing an object property, if the object propery doesn't exist, then when trying to access it the non-existing propery 
            returns 'undefined'. For example:
        </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {};<br>
            <br>
            alert(user.notAProperty === undefined); // returns true
        </p>
        <p>...the above returns true as the propery 'notAProperty' does not exist so has strict equality with 'undefined'.</p>
        <p>As an alternative, the operator "in" can be used to check the existance of a property using the syntax: "key" in objectName</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = { name: "Dan", age: "30", };<br>
            <br>
            alert ("age" in user); // returns true, as user.age exists.<br>
            alert ("gender" in user); // returns false, as user.gender does not exist.
        </p>
        <p>Note that the "key" property name on the left of the 'in' operator should be in quotation marks to indicate it as a propery name. 
            Otherwise, without quotation markes the 'in' operator would test against the value of a variable of that name, not propery. For example:
        </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = { age: 30 }; <br>
            <br>
            let key = 'age';<br>
            alert (key in user); // returns true, as key = 'age', and user.age exists.
        </p>

        <h2>The "for...in" Loop</h2>
        <p>
            The 'for...in' loop is a special form of loop which runs through all keys of an object. The syntax is: 
        </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            for (key in object) {<br>
                // executes the body for each key among object properties<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: 'Dan',<br>
                age: 30,<br>
                isAdmin: true,<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            for (let key in user) {<br>
                alert(key); // returns the keys, so: name, age, isAdmin<br>
                alert(user[key]); // returns the values of the keys, so: Dan, 30, true<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>Note that using for, we can declare the looping variable inside the loop like 'let key' above. Also note that the variable name 
            can be anything, so does not have to be 'key'.
        </p>

        <h2>Ordering Objects</h2>
        <p>If we loop over an object, do we get properties in the same order that they are added? The answer is 'sort of'. Numbers are sorted 
            in numberical order; all other types appear in creation order. For example:
        </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let codes = {<br>
                "49": "Germany", <br>
                "41": "Switzerland", <br>
                "44": "UK", <br>
                "1": "USA" <br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            for (let code in codes) {<br>
                alert(code); // returns 1, 41, 44, 49<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>Non-integers are sorted in the created order, for example: </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan",<br>
                surname: "B",<br>
            };<br>
            <br>
            user.age = 30 // to add one more<br>
            <br>
            for (let prop in user) {<br>
                alert(prop); // returns: name, surname, age<br>
                alert[(user[prop]); // returns Dan, B, 30<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>A simple solution to the problem of integers listing in numeric order when not required, is to prefix the integer with: +</p>
        <p>The + gets omitted, like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let codes = {<br>
                "+49": "Germany", <br>
                "+41": "Switzerland", <br>
                "+44": "UK", <br>
                "+1": "USA" <br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            for (let code in codes) {<br>
                alert(+code); // returns 49, 41, 44, 1<br>
            }
        </p>

        <h2>Copying By Reference</h2>
        <p>One of the fundamental differences of objects vs primates is that objects are stored and copied by reference.</p>
        <p>Primitive values, so string, numbers and booleans, are copied as a whole value. For example:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let message = "Hello";<br>
            let phrase = message;
        </p>
        <p>...we now have two variables, both storing string "Hello".</p>
        <p>But objects don't behave like that. Instead of string the object itself in a variable, it stores a reference to it, or it's 
            'address in memory' as it's known. 
        </p>
        <p>Take the object below:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan"<br>
            }<br>
        </p>
        <p>...here, the object itself is stored in the memory. The variable 'user' then is a reference to that object.</p>
        <p>When the object is copied, the reference is copied rather than the object itself. For example:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan"<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            let admin = user; // copies the reference 
        </p>
        <p>...we now have two variables, each referencing the same object. Either can be used to access and modify the contents of the object. For example:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan"<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            let admin = user;<br>
            <br>
            admin.name = 'Laura' // name changed via the admin reference<br>
            <br>
            alert(user.name)// returns 'Laura' changes seen from user reference.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparison By Reference</h2>
        <p>The equality == and strict equality === operators for objects work in the same way.</p>
