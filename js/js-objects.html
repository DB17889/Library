            <h1>Introduction to Objects</h1>
        </div>
        <p>As covered previously, JavaScript has 7 different data types. Whilst the other 6 are 'primitive', as they only hold one value,
            objects are more complex as they store collections of various elements. 
        </p>
        <p>An object is created with curly brackets: {}</p>
        <p>These brackets contain an option list of <i>properties</i>. Each property has a "Key: Value" relationship, where the key is a string
            which names the propery, and the value is any value.</p>
        <p>There are two syntaxes to use when creating an object; the second is more practical, and is refered to a <i>object literal</i>:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = new Object(); // Syntax is <i>Object Constructor</i><br>
            let user = {}; // Syntax is <i>Object Literal</i>
        </p>
        <p>Using "Key: Value" paired components, properties can be added straight into the object literal like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan",<br>
                age: 30,<br>
                isAdmin: true<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>...where the Key is followed by a colon (:) and the Value is followed by a comma (,) if another property is to be added.</p>
        <p>Propery values can be called on using the dot notation, like so:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            alert(user.name); // returns string: Dan<br>
            alert(user.age); // returns number: 30<br>
            alert(user.isAdmin); // returns boolean: true
        </p>
        <p>And the property values are set in the same way: </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            set user.name = "Dan";
        </p>
        <p>Removing a property from an object also uses dot notation, and is done so like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            delete user.name; // removes name property
        </p>
        <p>Typically, property names are camelCase, but they can be separate words. Just use quotation, like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan",<br>
                age: 30,<br>
                "Admin User": true<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>...but bear in mind, using multiword property Keys requires square brakets [] to be used when calling on that propery, 
            remembering the quotes still, like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            alert(user.["Admin User"]); // returns boolean: true
        </p>

        <h2>Computed Properties</h2>,
        <p>Computed properties are those which are defined within square brackets like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let fruit = prompt("Which fruit do you want?" "apple");<br>
            <br>
            let bag = {<br>
                [fruit]: 5<br>
            };<br>
            <br>
            alert(bag.apple); // returns 5 if fruit="Apple"
        </p>
        <p>So what is happening here:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We have variable `fruit` which is assigned whatever value the user inputs when prompted. In this case, the user 
                is prompted to enter apple, so just needs to confirm when prompted. 
            </li>
            <li>Then we have object bag which has a computed property `[fruit]`. As the property name is in square brackets, and does NOT contain
                quotations (like a multiword propery name covered previously would), the propery name simply inherits whatever value is assigned
                to the `fruit` variation. So in this case, the propery name is 'apple'.
            </li>
            <li>Therefore, the alert object.property, in this case bag.apple (where apple is inherited from `[fruit]`) returns 5.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Be aware, this does the same, but the first method is better as it is 'cleaner' to view:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let fruit = prompt("Which fruit do you want?" "apple");<br>
            let bag = {};<br>
            <br>
            bag[fruit] = 5;
        </p>
        <p>Typically, dot notication is easier to code. But bear in mind that square brackets are more powerful as they allow any propery names
            and variables.
        </p>

        <h2>Property Value Shorthand</h2>
        <p>In real code, we often use existing variables as values for property names. For example:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            function makeUser(name, age){<br>
                return {<br>
                    name: name,<br>
                    age: age, <br>
                    //etc...<br>
                };<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            let user = makeUser("Dan", 30);<br>
            alert(user.name); //returns Dan
        </p>
        <p>Above the property name and value name are the same, and this is very common with object properties, so shorthand is available
            meaning that just 'name' can be used instead of 'name: name' like this:
        </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            function makeUser(name, age){<br>
                return {<br>
                    name,<br>
                    age, <br>
                    //etc...<br>
                };<br>
        </p>
