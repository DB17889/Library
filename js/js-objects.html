            <h1>Introduction to Objects</h1>
        </div>
        <p>As covered previously, JavaScript has 7 different data types. Whilst the other 6 are 'primitive', as they only hold one value,
            objects are more complex as they store collections of various elements. 
        </p>
        <p>An object is created with curly brackets: {}</p>
        <p>These brackets contain an option list of <i>properties</i>. Each property has a "Key: Value" relationship, where the key is a string
            which names the propery, and the value is any value.</p>
        <p>There are two syntaxes to use when creating an object; the second is more practical, and is refered to a <i>object literal</i>:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = new Object(); // Syntax is <i>Object Constructor</i><br>
            let user = {}; // Syntax is <i>Object Literal</i>
        </p>
        <p>Using "Key: Value" paired components, properties can be added straight into the object literal like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan",<br>
                age: 30,<br>
                isAdmin: true<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>...where the Key is followed by a colon (:) and the Value is followed by a comma (,) if another property is to be added.</p>
        <p>Propery values can be called on using the dot notation, like so:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            alert(user.name); // returns string: Dan<br>
            alert(user.age); // returns number: 30<br>
            alert(user.isAdmin); // returns boolean: true
        </p>
        <p>And the property values are set in the same way: </p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            set user.name = "Dan";
        </p>
        <p>Removing a property from an object also uses dot notation, and is done so like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            delete user.name; // removes name property
        </p>
        <p>Typically, property names are camelCase, but they can be separate words. Just use quotation, like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            let user = {<br>
                name: "Dan",<br>
                age: 30,<br>
                "Admin User": true<br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>...but bear in mind, using multiword property Keys requires square brakets [] to be used when calling on that propery, 
            remembering the quotes still, like this:</p>
        <p class='code-block'>
            alert(user.["Admin User"]); // returns boolean: true
        </p>

        // CARRY ON FROM ABOUT 20% DOWN: Here, the variable key may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.
