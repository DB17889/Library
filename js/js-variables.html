        <h1>Introduction to Variables</h1>
        <p>A variable is essentially a named storage area for data. To create a variable, use the 'let'
            keyword. (You may see 'var' instead of 'let'; this is fine, but try and stick to 'let' as this
            is newer.) For example, to create a variable, or 'define' / 'declare' a variable:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let message; // declares a variable called 'message'
        </p>
        <p>...this is just an empty variable. To assign data to the variable, use the assignment 
            operator as below:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let message;<br>
            message = "Hello World!";
        </p>
        <p>...this then stores the string data 'Hello World!' to the memory area associated with the variable.
            This can be viewed using the alart command:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            alert(message); // returns 'Hello World!'
        </p>
        <p>For simplicity, the variable declration and the assignment of data can be completed in one go:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let message = 'Hello World!'; // declares the variable and assigns data in one go
        </p>
        <p>You can also declare multiple variables and assign data to them in one go too, for example:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let user = 'Dan', age = 29, message = 'Hello World!';
        </p>
        <p>...HOWEVER, whilst this might seem shorted, its not recommended from a code readability
            perspective. Declaring across multiple lines is the 'correct' thing to do, for example:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let user = 'Dan';<br>
            let age = 29;<br>
            let message = 'Hello World!';
        </p>
        <p>Or, you may see this as:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let user = 'Dan'<br>
            , age = 25<br>
            , message = 'Hello World!';
        </p>
        <p>A variable can be changed later in the code. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let message = 'Hello!'; // value stored as 'Hello!'<br>
            message = 'Goodbye!'; // value changed to 'Goodbye!'
        </p>
        <p>And a variable value can be assigned to another variable, using the variable. For example;
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            let hello = 'Hello!';<br>
            let message;<br>
            <br>
            message = hello;<br>
            <br>
            alert(hello); // returns 'Hello!'<br>
            alert(message); // returns 'Hello!'
        </p>
    </div>

        <h1>Naming Variables</h1>
        <p>There are a couple of restrictions when it comes to naming Variables:
        </p>
        <ul>The name can only contain letters, digits or the symbols $ and _.</ul>
        <ul>The first chracter must not be a character.</ul>
        <p>Often is JS, variables are named using camelCase if the variable is more than one word long,
            where the first words first character is lower case. For example: variableName or 
            thisIsMyVariable.
        </p>
        <p>Note that case DOES matter. For example, a variable called 'variable' is not the same as
            a variable called 'vARIABLE'.
        </p>
        <p>There are a list of reserved words that cannot be used as variables, as JS uses them for 
            specific functions, for example 'let', 'class' and 'function'. A full list of reserved 
            words is available <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords">
            here</a>.
            </p>        
    </div>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h1>Constant Variables</h1>
        <p>To declare a constant variable, i.e. one that does not change, use 'const' instead of 
            'let'.
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            const myBirthday = '17.08.1989';
        </p>
        <p>Variables declared using const are called 'constants'. Any attempt to change the data will
            result in error. For example:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            const myBirthday = '17.08.1989';<br>
            myBirthday = '01.01.1989'; // results in error as cannot reassign a constant.
        </p>
        <h2>Uppercase Constants</h2>
        <p>It's common practise for constants to be used as a shortcut for commonly used difficult-to-remember
            values known before execution. This common practise typically uses capital letters and underscores.
            For example:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
            const COLOR_RED = "#F00";<br>
            const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";<br>
            const COLOR_BLUE = "00F";<br>
            const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00"<br>
            <br>
            //meaning later, to pick a color use:<br>
            let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
        </p>

    </div>
